  <h3>Cumulative distribution function</h3>
  <p>
      The normal distribution cumulative distribution function (cdf): 
      $$ \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2}(1+erf(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}})) $$
      where \(erf(\cdot)\) is the error function: 
      $$ erf(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{z}e^{-x^2}dx $$
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\Phi(x)\) is the cumulative probablity of the normal-distributed random variable being less than \(x\). 
    To calculate such value for a given \(x\), we need to evaluate the error function \(erf(\cdot)\), which can be performed using numerical integration.
