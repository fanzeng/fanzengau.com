<h3>The quantile function</h3>
<p>
  The inverse of the cumulative distribution function, \(F(\cdot)=\Phi^{-1}(\cdot)\), is called the <em>quantile function</em>, which is useful in <em>hypothesis testing</em> and <em>confidence interval</em> calculations. We can simply solve for \(x\) using the expression of , to obtain the inverse function $$ F(p)=\sqrt{2}\sigma \cdot erf^{-1}(2p-1)+\mu $$
  By definition, \(F(p)\) is value for which there is \(p\) chance that the random variable takes a value below it.
</p>
<p>
  It follows that the probability that the random varible takes a value above \(F(p)\) is \(1-p\). By symmetry of the normal distribution probability distribution function, the probability that the random varible takes a value below \(\mu-F(p)\) is also \(1-p\).
</p>
<p>
  The \(F(p)\) for a standard normal distribution is often denoted as \(z_{p}\), since we know the mean and standard deviation for such a distribution is 0 and 1, we can plug them in and get $$ z_{p}(p)=\sqrt{2}\cdot erf^{-1}(2p-1) $$
</p>
<p>
  Now there is only one independent variable in \(z_{p}\), and we know it ranges from \([0, 1]\), so a plot can be generated by plugging in every value from 0 to 1 to the equation above.
