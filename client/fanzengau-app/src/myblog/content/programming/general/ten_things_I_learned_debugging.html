<h3>One thing at a time</h3>
<p>
  Only change one thing each time between testing of the program,
  unless the changes are really trivial.
  In this way, if something breaks, we know exactly what caused it.
  If multiple major and potentially dangerous
  moves have been made before a test is performed,
  too much time could be spent just trying to figure out
  what causes certain weired behavior which should be impossible.
