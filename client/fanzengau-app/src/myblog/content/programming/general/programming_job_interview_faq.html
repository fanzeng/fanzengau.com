C++
Q. Difference between struct and class?
A. In C, struct defaults to public, class defaults to private.

Q. The meaning of static?
A. Static variables and functions belong to the class and are shared by all instances of the class.

A. It's used to tell the compiler "the variable could be modified somewhere outside the program so don't try to optimize it".

Java
Q. Difference between final, finally and finalize?
A. In Java, final variable is cannot be changed once initialized, this is similar to "const" in C, final class cannot be inherited, final method cannot be overriden. 
The finally keyword is used in try/catch blocks to guarantee a block of code is executed even after an exception.
The finalize keyword related to the garbage collection process. A finalize method will be called before an objected is garbage collected.

Algorithms
Q. Write fizzbuzz.
A. This almost has become a meme. But refrain from laughing for "how can someone mess this up?". When you're at an interview, only 5% of your brain is working. So here you go:
Write a loop, inside the loop, if "is_fizz" print "fizz", without break the line of printing, if "is_buzz" print "buzz". That's it.
That is the simplest solution, and if you allow a print function that doesn't end the line, you can go with that. However, if that's not the case, or the question requires you to output into a string, you need to check "is_fizzbuzz" first.
