    Merging. The dreadful terms for new drivers, and yes, new Git users.
    Working in a big team is hard,
    but there are some rules of thumb for keeping everyone happy,
    as I humbly summarize below.
    Feel free to use them the other way around of course
    if you enjoy the feeling of being smashed on the head by a keyboard.
    Basically, everything boils down to: Make it nice and easy for your fellow programmers
    by reducing as much as possible the need for them to adapt to your changes. If a merge conflict can be avoided,
    it's best to try and avoid it.

    <h3>
      Make good use of commit messages
    </h3>
    Compulsory commit messages may seem annoying, but it is a bless when you are in a big team and everyone is actively
    making changes to the code base. There are plenty of tutorials on how to form nice commit messages and how to avoid
    stating the obvious. Here I just want to highlight the point that when you do have to change something taken by everyone
    else as granted, please tell them about it in the commit message. Even you will thank yourself three months later.
    For example, if you changed a path that some one might have been using, or renamed a public interface, 
    or a file that people have been using in their codes, as soon as they pull your commit, their code is
    going to break. It is good manner to let them know this in advance and provide them instructions on how to fix it, 
    if you can't fix it in your commit already.
    It is good practice to tidy up codes and combine redundant stuff from time to time, but when you do so,
    finish up with adequate announcements. Whenever you are deprecating stuff, think about how it's
    going to impact others, is it going to affect only yourself, or is it going to require everyone to update their
    setups? If the latter is true, a good commit message could be like "Heads up: If you pull this commit, please set
    the following environment variable ...".

    <h3>
      Don't break master.
    </h3>
    Master should always compile. Unit tests on master should always pass. Period. No playing around on master branch
    since you can do whatever you like in your own branch.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>
      Don't hard code your paths.
    </h3>
    Your platform, your username might not suit everyone.
    Don't require your peer coders to change your customized paths every time they pull your stuff. Use config files,
    command line variables, use platform agnostic paths so that slashes tilt in the correct way.
    Don't merge into master a unit test that requires a local file on your computer. When you develop, write code as if
    it's going to be tested in a different environment, e.g. a docker container. If you're on Linux, think about whether
    some one can run it on Windows or MAC, and vice versa.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>
      Don't unnecessarily introduce dependencies.
    </h3>

    If you find a cool library that you'd like to use, think about whether it can be added without much pain, for
    example, can it be installed in a local directory or run within a sand box. It might be as easy for you to install
    something as it being a complete nightmare for other people. Some may already be using other stuff that's in
    conflict with your new toy, some may not have root previleges to install at all. When you try out a new version of a
    library, it might run just seamlessly, but the guy sitting next to you may not be as lucky.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't change behavior of things that others may be using. If you really have to, don't do it too often, only do it
    when absolute necessary. And you should be responsible for fixing everything you break. Keep in mind whenever you
    make major changes there is high chance you're breaking every else's code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce git history rewrites. Git is invented to prevent accidental loss of work.
