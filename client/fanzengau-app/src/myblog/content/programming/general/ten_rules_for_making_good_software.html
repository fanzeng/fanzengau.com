<h3>Dependency minimumism</h3>
<p>
  Remember, the more dependencies your program has,
  the more likely that some one is going to run into dependency issues and thus not able to use your program.
  It is also more likely that your program will break in the future,
  because e.g. some function in some library you use has been deprecated,
  or, your libraries are all kind enough to not touch the legacy
  public interface, but they can't control their third party dependencies, can they?

  For example, a project depends on a particular version of CUDA,
  which does not play very well in the backwards-compatibility game,
  and people with the latest Nvidia GPU may not have the old version of CUDA.
  It can be very possible that such a repository can go obselete
  when more and more people upgrades their CUDA
  and lose the ability to compile the project.
  Same goes with OpenCV, if a project supports only a lower version of OpenCV,
  then people with higher versions might encounter errors and give up on using the repository.

<h3>Check for edge cases and produce warnings</h3>
<p>
  It's most likely better to fail with an meaningful error message
  than to run seamingly well with hidden bugs.
  If you really don't have time, at least type 4 letters, "TODO".

<h3>Get a unique name</h3>
<p>
  This applies to nearly all commerical products. A good name of a software (company)
  should be not only easy to remember, but also unique. Famous examples include
  "Alibaba" and "Amazon". For one thing, you don't need to spell it out to people hearing it
  for the first time. More importantly, notice the name does not necessarity have to
  directly relate to what the business is about. Some not-as-good example would include those
  exactly violate the "uniqe" principle in order to show the user what they do.
  For instance, a very useful math package for matrix manipulation is called "Eigen".
  Its name tells you what it's designed for, but it makes it harder to search
  things related to it on the internet. Try search how a vector is implemented in
  this package by googling "eigen vector".
