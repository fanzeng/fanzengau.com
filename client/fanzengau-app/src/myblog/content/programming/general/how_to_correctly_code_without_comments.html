    Commnens are ignored by computers, and, to some extent, programmers. To be honnest, we've all been there when we
    just needed to check if a brilliant idea works and were only given 782 seconds. No one has the time and extra brain
    cells to write comments under that pressure. And frankly, the quality of the comments written in such hurry will be
    horrific too.
  </p>

<h3>Why comments</h3>
So why do everyone says we need comments. The reason is simple: To save time in the future.

If our code is any good, it is (hopefully) going to be used. And if it's used, someone would likely want to improve it.
This means at some stage, some lucky person (could be yourself) will have to try and understand the code you write today
in order to apply the envisioned changes. It is not suggested at all to modify code unless you completely understand it
or the author explicitly said so (e.g. "This chunk of code doesn't do anything really, feel free to delete it").

Typically one would spend most of her day deciphering existing code, so that she can apply the updates in just a
fraction of a minute before going home. This doesn't feel like productive, and when big boss walks past, you don't want
him to ask: "Why aren't you typing on your keyboard? I didn't hire you to stare at your screen!?"

Thus, we write down our programming thoughts to minimize our screen-staring time.

<h3>Then why not comment</h3>
Because comments lie. Because everytime you change code, you will need to remember to change the associated comments.
Well it sounds all right if we just apply a little bit of discipline, right? Except, you don't always know all the
comments that should be changed when you change code (sadly, no IDE is smart enought to tell you that either when this
article is written). For instance, you change the behavior of a function, and respectfully update the comments above it.
However, there are callers of this function who may have comments that are invalidated as well. Note, if you code in the
right way, you shouldn't induce the need to change existing callers of a function as you modify it, especially when you
are not the only user of your code.

A secondary reasoning has to do with information entropy. Too much unnecessary comments weigh down the significance of
those really important ones. People will pay more attention to your comments if you only comment when absolutely
necessary, they know they'll be in trouble if they don't.

In a word, bad comments are worse than no comment. Let's review some cases where comments are not welcome.

<h3>When Not to comment</h3>
Short answer: When you can do so just as well with coding.
<li>
  First of all, please don't state the obvious. We all understand what "if else" means. Remember, your code should be as
  self-documentary as possible. Mondern programming languages allow you to do so by having mostly consistent keywords
  and behaviors (ignore this one if you're a php user).
</li>

<li>
  When you can embed comments in the names.
  Instead of "int a1", you can say "int number_of_customer". Instead of "function doSomeWork()" you can say "function
  calcActiveMember()".
</li>

<li>
  When you can explain the logic as you code.
  If you have a big function that does several things in sequence, and you think you'd better explain, see if you can
  seperate them into smaller functions with meaningful names, into which you pack in the explanation. In general,
  whenever you have something so big that you feel obliged to explain, try to separate them into smaller components, and
  do the explanation with code.
  If you are expecting the arguments in certain formats / ranges, do the check with code statements or even a function,
  and reject invalid inputs with a polite "please go tidy up yourself". This is more effective than a comment saying
  "please pass positive integers only" etc.
</li>

<li>
  Exploit language mechanisms.
  If you find yourself asking people not to do something, don't comment yet, see if you can simply make it impossible
  for them to do so. The future-you will get an error when attempting to do so, get your embeded message, and hopefully
  thank (instead of curse) you. Comments like "don't change this variable once assigned" or "don't inherit from this
  class" can be replaced by "const" or "final". If you don't want a function to be directly called, hide it with
  "private".
</li>

That being said, there are also scenarios where comments are as helpful as they intend to.

<h3>When to comment</h3>
Short answer: When you do something super unexpected or super ingenious. You will definitely know when you are about to
do it. It usually happens after a prolonged period of deliberation (read: premeditation).

<li>
  You hardcoded magic numbers. Just leave a word for future-you, "feel free to convert it to a variable", or "hardcoded
  for a reason, sun won't come out tomorrow if changed to a variable."
</li>

<li>
  You are going to exploit a bug in the particular version of a compiler. You should definitely comment and include "use
  such and such compiler" in all relevant instructions.
</li>

<li>
  Code has to be like that for pretty non-obvious reasons. Say you have a flag variable in the program logic, but don't
  care about it when certain condition A is met, so you didn't bother to set the flag in code segments where logic
  dictates that condition A must be true. Upon first reading, people would think you might have a bug, the same thought
  process needs to be repeated over and over again whenever someone reads your code. Solution: Leave the God-praised
  comment.
</li>

<li>
  You foresee potential pitfalls but just don't have time to guard against it with solid code. During software
  development, it is way easier to debug a program that quits with an (correct and verbose) error than one that runs
  smoothly but give you incorrect result (at random times). If you alreay know there are edge cases that can break the
  logic of the algorithm, make a note so that future head-scratchings can be reduced.
</li>

<li>
  Your program can modify things that (normal) people won't expect it to, e.g. "dumps ship to /tmp/lalala/". Or your
  program requires a certain environment to run correctly, e.g. "requires environment variable $carbon-dioxide to be
  set, otherwise will nuke current directory."
</li>

<li>
  You are doing something temperarily. Maybe you just need to quickly test something in an improper way (Proper way: Use
  git and branch out). Please tag your experiment even if you know you will revert it in 2 minuntes. In fact, leave the
  comment before you commit the crime. Reason: You phone can ring and you will forget.
